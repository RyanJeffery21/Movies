## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to take in new data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and Movielens and create a SQL database that had only relevant data to be used for a Hackathon.  

## Process
We created a function that created three seperate dataframes of the data from the different websites.  We then filtered out and removed unnecessary data and formatted the remaining data to be consistent across the databases.  The databases were then merged to form a single database with separate tables that can be queried in SQL by the participants in the Hackathon.
